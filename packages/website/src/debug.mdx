# Debug

The debug tool of Scroom can help you locate the problem quickly.

```js
import { setup, debug } from "scroom";

const sc = setup(...);

debug(sc)
```

## Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const ref = React.useRef();
    React.useEffect(() => {
      const sc = setup({
        target: ref.current,
      });
      debug(sc);
      return () => {
        sc.destory();
      };
    }, []);
    return <div ref={ref} style={{ height: "300px" }} />;
  }}
</Playground>

<br />

You can also provide a debug ID.

```js
debug(sc, "your-id");
```

## Important

It is not recommended to use debug tool in a production environment. It will affect performance and bundle size.
